	 Minimum game version this skin requires to be valid, and listed as an option in the list of skins .
	 
	 This is used for two things: 
	 - First of all you can force a skin to only be available for a minimum minor release (ie patch), in other words
	 setting the required_version to 7.0.1 makes sure the skin won't be listed if the game is in version 7.0.0.
	 - Secondly, the first number ("major version") is used to decide which version the skin was designed for,
	 so if the version is "7.0.0" it won't be listed in the list of skins if the game version is "6.0.0." or "8.0.0",
	 even though 7 is less than 8.
